üêç Classic Snake Game (Python)

This is a modern version of the classic Snake Game, built using Python and the Pygame library.

In this game, the player controls a snake that moves across the screen to collect food (represented as small circles). Each time the snake eats food:

    ‚úÖ The score increases

    üêç The snake grows longer

Key Features:

    Smooth snake movement and real-time collision detection

    Score tracking system

    Game restart option

    Minimalist but intuitive user interface using Pygame

This project showcases skills in:

    Object-oriented programming in Python

    Event handling and game loop logic

    Real-time animation and keyboard input

    GUI development with Pygame

Ideal for demonstrating logic, timing, and user interaction handling in games.
